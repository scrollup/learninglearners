<section id="about">
    <p>
        Learning Learners has grown along with the children we’ve been supporting these past few years. 
        As the needs of the children grow, so have we expanded to include everything your child needs. 
        Our most recent addition is the opening of a center in the heart of Crown Heights, 
        on the beautiful Eastern Parkway right across the street from Oholei Torah Yeshiva.
    </p>
    <p>
        We’re always about providing support that goes full circle and accommodates student, 
        provider, and family.

    <h2>Advocacy</h2>
    <p>
        Every day at Learning Learners is one of progress, and we are committed to provide the specific support that 
        your child needs. That is why we create an advocacy team for each student, including a site supervisor, 
        experienced special education teacher, and third-party consultants.

    <h2>Support</h2>
    <p>
        We view the process through the eyes of a child and the heart of a parent. Slow and steady, without boundaries 
        and with lots of love. We understand the struggles associated with the complexities of special ed and hold 
        your hand throughout the process.

<section id="commitment">
    <h2>Commitment</h2>
    <p>
        Since our primary goal remains the eventual mainstreaming of your child, we remain committed to that goal 
        throughout the intervention phases. Learning Learners features a staff of hand-picked special education teachers, 
        related service providers, and paraprofessionals. We further monitor the progress via staff supervision and remain 
        committed to you via parent training seminars. Our commitment knows no bounds and is evident in our active and 
        involved meeting prep with the local CSE [Committee on Special Education].

    <h2>The Center</h2>
