        <h2>About The Center</h2>
        <p>Learning Learners has grown along with the children we’ve been supporting these past few years. As the needs of the children grow, so have we expanded to include everything your child needs. Our most recent addition is the opening of a center in the heart of Crown Heights, on the beautiful Eastern Parkway right across the street from Oholei Torah Yeshiva.</p>
        <p>We’re always about providing support that goes full circle and accommodates student, provider, and family. Located at 678 Eastern Parkway, the center provides the opportunity for students to relax and learn at their own pace without external distractions. We are fully stocked with healthy snacks, water, and even hot cocoa!</p>
        <p>The center also has a kitchen, which provides for the opportunity for extra-curricular baking classes as well as a room for art. Please reach out if you would feel that your child can gain from these activities.</p>
        <p>We view the process through the eyes of a child and the heart of a parent. Slow and steady, without boundaries and with lots of love. We understand the struggles associated with the complexities of special ed and hold your hand throughout the process.</p>
